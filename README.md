# DrNiceFellow's Web-based Intelligent Roleplaying Sandbox

![Screenshot](/assets/screenshot.png)

This is a sophisticated chat WebUI developed by Dr. Nicefellow. It is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with a chatbot. The backend engine is powered by OpenAI API, and the backend LLM should support the Llama Chat/Mistral Instruct prompt template. It is tested with Tabbyapi.

One of the key advantages of this chatbot over others, such as SillyTavern, is its ability to automatically determine who should talk next. This feature enhances the flow of the conversation and provides a more engaging user experience.
