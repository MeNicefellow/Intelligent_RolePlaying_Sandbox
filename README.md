# DrNiceFellow's Web-based Intelligent Roleplaying Sandbox

![Screenshot](/assets/screenshot.png)

This is a lightweight and intelligent Role Playing Sandbox with Web UI developed by Dr. Nicefellow. It is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with a chatbot. The backend engine is powered by OpenAI API with completions function. It is tested with Tabbyapi.

One of the key advantages of this chatbot over others, such as SillyTavern, is its ability to automatically determine who should talk next and its support for third-party narrators to describe environment changes and other context. These features enhance the flow of the conversation and provide a more engaging user experience. [mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) as the backend LLM has been tested working well. [SanjiWatsuki/Silicon-Maid-7B](https://huggingface.co/SanjiWatsuki/Silicon-Maid-7B) as well.
