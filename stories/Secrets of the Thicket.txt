The group is gathered around a crackling campfire in a secluded park, its flames casting a warm, flickering light. The ground is dotted with tents and camping gear, creating a cozy, makeshift campsite. The sky is a tapestry of stars, and the forest around them is a dark silhouette against the night sky. A cooler of beer and an array of snacks are casually spread out, with everyone lounging around the fire on camping chairs and logs, engaged in light-hearted banter. The mood is jovial, but a tense undercurrent flows beneath the surface, known only to John.</div><div style="color: #137136;">Mark: John, thank you organizing this trip! <i>Putting his hand on the shoulder of John</i></div><div style="color: #463267;">John: <i>Forces a smile</i> Yeah, no problem, guys.

</div><div style="color: black;">Everyone raises their own bottles and joins in the toast, clinking them together.
